A branch represents an independent line of development. For example, when you want to add a new feature or fix a bug - no matter how big or small - you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes sure that unstable code is never committed to the main code base and it gives you the chance to clean up your feature's history before merging it into the main branch (master).
